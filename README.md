# Fractalnet
### Solution for 2016 Space Apps Challenge
Fractalnet is a design for a network of low power radio relay devices that can be placed in environments that do not allow long range propagation of RF signals, such as caves, caverns, etc.  The specific use case involves deployment on the moon, Mars, asteroids and other planets during exploration by astronauts and robots.
